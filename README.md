# maze-TransactionVerify
A programm pretending to be something it isn't.

<strong>This here is only the source code!</strong><br>
If you want to download the programm itself you can do that on https://mazebank.co.uk<br>
You can also support me on https://hase.one if you want to.<br>
Thank's!

<b>The idea of MazeBank:</b><br>
MazeBank is an imaginary bank used for scambaiting.<br>
One of it's 'products' is called TransactionVerify and it's pretending to verify
credit card transactions. <br>Actually it's doing nothing but you hypothetically could 
bind it with a RAT or something.<br>
But: I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING DONE WITH THIS PROGRAM.<br>
So do whatever you want with it ;)
